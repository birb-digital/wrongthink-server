# warranty
no warranty is provided with this software. the security of your communications is not guaranteed.

the security of your communications is determined by many factors, including but not limited to:
* the browser and extensions you are running (and tabs you have open if your computer is vulnerable to Spectre or Meltdown)
* the software on your computer (especially if your computer is vulnerable to Spectre or Meltdown)
* your operating system (are you sure your OS isn't bugged?)
* hardware (hardware can be bugged)
* physical surveillance
* network surveillance (passive attacks, active attacks, etc.)
* the software itself (are there any vulnerabilities?)
* YOU (are you taking the right security precautions? are you using the built in security features?)
* time (an adversary may not be able to decrypt your conversations now, but they could be decrypted when quantum computers are feasible)

it's hard to get it right, and communications will not be safe forever. we believe that your communications should be secure for at least 5 years or until quantum computers are more advanced. however, security is not guaranteed. you are using this software at your own risk. if you are confident that all of these factors are in your favor, then go ahead and use it. otherwise, don't. cryptography will not help if you or your computer are compromised.

# security policy
